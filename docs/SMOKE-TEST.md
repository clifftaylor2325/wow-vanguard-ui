# Vanguard smoke test (for the owner)

Run this once in the WoW Forever beta after the P0 branch is merged. **Nothing in it has been seen in the game.** Every "Expect" line is what the code intends, read from the source when this was written, not something anyone watched happen. A step that fails is the useful result: it tells us what to fix.

Written against the Forever client build 1.60.1.70170 (the Blizzard UI source the code was checked against). `/vg status` prints the build you are really on.

Things to know before you start:

- The checklist changes your saved settings (a throwaway profile, `/vg reset all`). Use a spare character, or run `/vg export` first and keep the string.
- Steps that need other players (party, raid, main tank, ready check) or an instance are marked "if you can". Do not block the report on them.
- Where an Expect depends on an earlier fix, a bracketed note says which. If that fix did not land, the note says what you will see instead.
- Quote chat lines as they appear; a missing or different line is a finding.

## Report block

For every failed step, paste all of this (steps below say "If it fails, paste:" for anything extra):

1. The step id (for example `3.3`).
2. The whole output of `/vg status`. Today it is five lines: the version, profile and module count; the skinned, painted and waiting-on-combat counts; the client line (`Client WoW Forever`, the build, `auras on the engine` or `auras on the fallback`, `aura values readable` or `hidden right now`, and whether secure snippets work); a `Client has: ... lacks: ...` line; and the `UI scale ... text ... chat ...` line.
3. The whole output of `/vg errors`: either `No errors caught this session.`, or a header with the version, interface number and error count, the client line, and each error with `(xN)` and its stack lines.
4. A screenshot (Print Screen; the files land in the game's Screenshots folder).

Shortcut: `/vg report` puts items 2 and 3 in one box, selected for copying (`### Vanguard report v1 ###` to `### end ###`), with the screen size, the modules turned off and the skins. Press Ctrl+C and paste it whole; it is the same block the feedback form on vanguardui.com reads.

## 1. Install and first login

### 1.1 Link the addon

- Do: in a clone of the repository run `npm run link:wow -- --wow "<folder that has Interface/AddOns>"`, then `npm run link:wow -- --status`. (Or unzip a release into `Interface/AddOns/` and skip this step.)
- Expect: a message ending `/reload in game.`, and `--status` reporting the link. If a real Vanguard folder is already there, the message is `... is an installed copy. Add --replace to move it aside and link this clone.`
- If it fails, paste: the whole terminal output of both commands.

### 1.2 First login opens the setup wizard

- Do: at character select open AddOns and tick Vanguard, then log in on an account that has never run it (or delete `WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/Vanguard.lua` first).
- Expect: the setup wizard opens by itself with the caption `Step 1 of 4 · Layout`. If you log in during combat it waits and says `Setup opens when combat ends.`
- If it fails, paste: the Report block.

### 1.3 Status

- Do: type `/vg status`.
- Expect: the lines described in the Report block. The client line says `Client WoW Forever` and `auras on the engine`. [After P0.3: `auras on the fallback` means the client refused the aura container and Vanguard fell back; `/vg errors` should say so.] [After P0.6 and P0.11: the `Client has:` line and a `secure snippets: yes` part are present; `secure snippets: no (hover keys off)` means the client could not run secure snippets.]
- If it fails, paste: the whole `/vg status` output and `/vg errors`.

### 1.4 No errors yet

- Do: type `/vg errors`.
- Expect: `No errors caught this session.` Anything else is the first bug report. [After P0.2: each entry shows a count and a stack.]
- If it fails, paste: the whole `/vg errors` output.

## 2. Options window and wizard

### 2.1 Every options page

- Do: type `/vg`, then click each page in the left list in turn: General, Modules, Unit frames, Raid frames, Healing, Click casting, Action bars, Quests, Nameplates, Bars, map, chat, Situations and Profiles (12 pages in all; the order of Quests and Nameplates is whatever the window shows). After each, type `/vg errors`.
- Expect: each page draws its rows with no Lua error popup, and `/vg errors` stays empty.
- If it fails, paste: the page name, a screenshot of it, and `/vg errors`.

### 2.2 The wizard, start to finish

- Do: type `/vg setup`. Click Next three times, then Done.
- Expect: `Step 1 of 4 · Layout` with three choices (Centered: damage and tanking, Centered: healing, Like the game's); Next goes to `Step 2 of 4 · Screen`, with a choice per screen size (1080p, 1440p, 4K, Ultrawide), the one for your screen marked `your screen`, and `Keep my current sizes`; Next goes to `Step 3 of 4 · Look` (the accent swatches and the raid frame style); Next goes to `Step 4 of 4 · Move things` with every frame's handle showing; the button then says Done, and Done hides the handles and the wizard. Escape and the close button do the same. After `/reload` the wizard does not come back by itself.
- If it fails, paste: the step id, the caption you saw, and `/vg errors`.

### 2.3 The healing layout

- Do: type `/vg setup`, pick Centered: healing, click Next once, then close the wizard. Open `/vg` and look at Click casting.
- Expect: the raid frames sit centred above the cast bar, growing upward; click casting is on. If Raid frames or Click casting were off before, closing the wizard offers a reload (`Setup turned on a module that was off.`).
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

## 3. Unlock, dragging and Edit Mode

### 3.1 Unlock

- Do: type `/vg unlock`, then `/vg frames`.
- Expect: the chat line `Unlocked: drag the handles. /vg lock when done.`, labelled handles on the Vanguard frames, and `/vg frames` listing keys such as `minimap`, `infostrip`, `menustrip`, `bagstrip`, `raid` and `questtracker`.
- If it fails, paste: the chat output and a screenshot.

### 3.2 Drag two frames and keep them

- Do: drag the Minimap and Info strip handles somewhere new, type `/vg lock`, then `/reload`.
- Expect: `Locked.` and, after the reload, both frames where you left them.
- If it fails, paste: which frame moved back and `/vg errors`.

### 3.3 Combat while unlocked

- Do: type `/vg unlock`, then start a fight with a mob. During the fight type `/vg unlock` again, and after it ends once more, then type `/vg lock` so the frames are locked again.
- Expect: `Locked for combat. /vg unlock again afterwards.` and the handles gone when the fight starts; during the fight `/vg unlock` prints `In combat. Try again once combat ends.`; after the fight `/vg unlock` works again.
- If it fails, paste: the chat lines and `/vg errors`.

### 3.4 Edit Mode

- Do: make sure the frames are locked (`/vg lock`), press Escape, click Edit Mode, look, close Edit Mode. (If `/vg unlock` had the handles up already, closing Edit Mode leaves them up; that is intended.)
- Expect: Vanguard's labelled handles appear too, with a note under the Edit Mode window reading `The labeled handles are Vanguard's frames: drag them here too (right-click one for more).` On closing, the handles hide and the Blizzard frames Vanguard pins (minimap, strips, tracker) return to their Vanguard spots.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot while Edit Mode is open and `/vg errors`.

### 3.5 Reset

- Do: type `/vg reset all`.
- Expect: `Reset N frame(s).` with N above zero, and the frames back at their default spots.
- If it fails, paste: the chat line.

## 4. Profiles and import

### 4.1 Switch profile

- Do: type `/vg profile Smoke`, click Reload in the dialog, then after the reload type `/vg profile`.
- Expect: a dialog saying `This character now uses profile Smoke. Reload the UI now to apply it?` with Reload and Later; Reload reloads the UI; afterwards `Profile: Smoke   (all: Default, Smoke)`. [After P0.7: the Reload button is a secure macro button. If the click does nothing, type `/reload` yourself and say that the button was dead.]
- If it fails, paste: whether the button reloaded, and `/vg errors`.

### 4.2 Import garbage

- Do: type `/vg import`, paste `garbage`, click Import. Then export (step 4.3), cut the string in half, and import that.
- Expect: `Import failed: not a Vanguard profile string.` for the garbage, and `Import failed: the string is incomplete (was it cut off when pasting?).` for the cut string; no error popup either time.
- If it fails, paste: the chat lines and `/vg errors`.

### 4.3 Export

- Do: type `/vg export`.
- Expect: a text box titled `Vanguard export (profile Smoke)  Ctrl+C to copy` holding one long string.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot.

## 5. Pixel borders

### 5.1 Border width at 1440p

- Do: set the game to 2560x1440 and UI scale 1.0 (the game's UI Scale setting, usually under Options, System, Advanced; confirm the path in your client). Take a screenshot of the player frame's edge and zoom in. Type `/vg status`.
- Expect: the border exactly 1 screen pixel wide, and `UI scale 1.00` in the status text line. [After P0.4. Before it the border is 2 px at 1440p, because the old size was one UI unit rounded to whole pixels.]
- If it fails, paste: the zoomed crop, your resolution, and the `UI scale` line.

## 6. Party and raid

### 6.1 Party frames (if you can)

- Do: join a party.
- Expect: party frames just above the player frame, growing upward, and the game's own party frames gone.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

### 6.2 Raid frames (if you can)

- Do: as leader or assistant, press the Raid button on the raid tools bar (top left) to convert to a raid, then press Ready on the same bar.
- Expect: raid frames in groups, 100x48 tiles at 10 members or fewer and smaller above that; the ready check starts.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`. In an instance during combat `/vg status` should say `aura values hidden right now` while the bars still fill; paste that line if the bars do not fill.

### 6.3 Main tank tiles (if you can)

- Do: in a raid, mark a main tank.
- Expect: a small tile for that player at the top left, beside the raid tools, with health in their class colour.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

## 7. Combat visuals: auras, cast bars, nameplates

### 7.1 Target and focus auras

- Do: target a mob that has a buff, put a damage-over-time debuff on it, then type `/focus` with it targeted.
- Expect: debuffs under the target and focus frames, buffs above them, wrapping at the frame width, with timers off by default.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot, `/vg status` and `/vg errors`. [After P0.3 and P0.12: a rejected aura filter word is listed in `/vg errors`.]

### 7.2 Cast bars

- Do: cast a spell with a long cast time, and have a mob cast at you.
- Expect: your cast bar between the player and target frames with a spark and the seconds left, and a latency segment at the end of your own cast; a gray edge on a cast that cannot be interrupted.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot during a cast and `/vg errors`.

### 7.3 Nameplates in a pull

- Do: pull three or more mobs.
- Expect: plates coloured by reaction and threat with the level shown, your debuffs on them, and your target's plate with an accent border and diamond. A plate first drawn during the fight uses Vanguard's own icons and switches to the client's after the fight.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot taken during the pull and `/vg errors`.

## 8. Quests

### 8.1 Quest dialog

- Do: under `/vg > Quests` tick Accept quests and Turn in finished quests (they are off by default). Talk to a quest giver who offers three or more quests. Press a number key, Space and Escape in turn. Then talk to a quest giver again without Shift (a quest is accepted for you), and once more holding Shift.
- Expect: Vanguard's dialog at the bottom centre with numbered lines in difficulty colours; the number picks a line, Space presses the main button (Accept, Continue or Complete), Escape says goodbye; without Shift the ticked automation runs; with Shift held, no automation runs and the dialog stays open for you.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

### 8.2 Long quest text

- Do: open a quest with a very long description.
- Expect: the text fits or scrolls inside the panel, with no overflow outside it.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and the quest name.

### 8.3 Quest log

- Do: fill the quest log (as many quests as it lets you take; the limit on Forever is not confirmed), then press the quest log key and type `/vg quests`.
- Expect: Vanguard's log with quests under their zones (click a zone to fold it), `[12] Title` lines in difficulty colours, and Track or Untrack, Share, Abandon and Map for the chosen quest. If it is off, `/vg quests` says `Vanguard's quest log is off (/vg > Quests).`
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

### 8.4 Quest tracker overflow

- Do: watch more quests than fit under the info strip.
- Expect: a `+N more` line at the bottom of the tracker.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot.

## 9. Bags, merchant, trainer

### 9.1 Bag search

- Do: open your bags and type in the search box.
- Expect: the combined bag in the Vanguard look; items that do not match dim as the game dims them; the search box is themed; a Sort button is present if this client can sort bags.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

### 9.2 Merchant repair and sell

- Do: with damaged gear and gray items, open a merchant who repairs.
- Expect: `Repaired for <money>.` (or `Not enough gold to repair (<money>).`) and `Selling N junk item(s).` in chat; the gray items vanish over a few seconds.
- If it fails, paste: the chat lines and `/vg errors`.

### 9.3 Trainer: Train all

- Do: at a class trainer with skills you can afford, click Train all. Try it again in combat if you can.
- Expect: a button reading `Train all (N) · <money>` on the trainer window; clicking it prints `Trained N skill(s) for <money>.`; in combat it does nothing.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot of the trainer window and `/vg errors`.

## 10. Click casting

### 10.1 Make a binding

- Do: type `/vg`, open Click casting, click Set key and press Shift+Q (a hover key) or Shift and left-click, set Action to Spell, type a spell name, and click Add binding. Then type `/vg binds`.
- Expect: the key text `Shift + Q (hover)` or `Shift + Left click` in the editor and a row in the list below; `/vg binds` prints `Click casting (this spec):` and then `  Shift + Q (hover)  ->  <spell>`.
- If it fails, paste: the `/vg binds` output and `/vg errors`.

### 10.2 Use it

- Do: out of combat, hover a party or raid tile (or your own frame) and press the key or click.
- Expect: the spell is cast on that unit. [After P0.11: if `/vg status` says `secure snippets: no`, hover keys are off on purpose and only mouse bindings work; paste that status line.]
- If it fails, paste: `/vg binds`, `/vg status` and `/vg errors`.

### 10.3 Bar 1 pages with stances and forms

- Do: on a warrior, druid or rogue, change stance, form or stealth out of combat, then again in a fight; also press Shift+2 and Shift+1.
- Expect: bar 1's icons change with each stance, form or stealth and with Shift+number, in and out of combat, and the button casts what it shows. This holds whether `/vg status` says `secure snippets: yes` or `no` (with `no`, bar 1 pages through the game's own page attribute).
- If it fails, paste: your class, what you changed, what the bar showed, `/vg status` and `/vg errors`.

## 11. AFK

### 11.1 AFK card

- Do: standing still out of combat, type `/afk`. Move. Type `/afk` again, then click or press a key.
- Expect: the screen dims to a card with your name in your class colour, level and class, the zone, time away, the clock and an XP bar; moving removes it; a click or key removes it until you are next away; it never shows in combat.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

## 12. Game menu

### 12.1 The Vanguard button

- Do: press Escape, look at the menu, click the Vanguard button.
- Expect: the Vanguard button first, above Options, with a gap under it; clicking it closes the menu and opens the options window. [After P0.9. If P0.9 did not land, the button is last, under Return to Game, as in your first screenshot.]
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot of the menu and `/vg errors`.

### 12.2 The game's own buttons still work

- Do: from the game menu click Edit Mode, Options, Macros and AddOns in turn, out of combat and then in combat.
- Expect: each opens, and no `Interface action failed because of an AddOn` message appears.
- If it fails, paste: that message text, which button and whether you were in combat, and `/vg errors`.

## 13. Menu and bag strips

### 13.1 Placement

- Do: look at the bottom-right corner at UI scale 1.
- Expect: the bag strip left of the menu strip with a gap and no overlap; the menu strip shows on mouseover (the default) or always if you set Game menu buttons under Bars, map, chat; no brass box inside either strip. [After P0.14. Before it, the overlap and the box from your first screenshot are expected.]
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot of the corner.

### 13.2 Every button works

- Do: click every micro button the Forever menu has (Character, Spellbook, Talents, Achievements, Quest log, Guild or Social, group finder, Collections, Adventure guide, Shop, Game menu) and every bag button, including the key ring button if there is one.
- Expect: each opens its window or bag. [The key ring button is skinned only after P0.14.]
- If it fails, paste: which button, a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

### 13.3 Move the strips

- Do: type `/vg unlock`, drag the Bags and Game menu handles apart, type `/vg lock`, then `/reload`.
- Expect: both strips stay where you put them.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot after the reload.

## 14. Game windows, by area

Each stream of `docs/handoff/RESKIN-PLAN.md` adds its steps here as `###` subsections with fixed numbers, so parallel streams never collide: 14.2 mail, guild, channels, friends (S1); 14.3 stable, trainer, bags, loot and item dialogs (S2); 14.4 game options, Edit Mode, keybinding and help (S3); 14.5 world map, group finder, calendar and Legacy (S4); 14.6 menus and tooltips (S5); 14.7 the game's swing timer, aura frames, crafting cast bar, possess bar and zone text (S6); 14.8 tabs and the inside of the character pane (S7); 14.9 battleground windows (S8). For every window: it has the flat panel with the theme's close button and title, its buttons and tabs still work, and `/vg errors` stays empty.

### 14.1 Switches

- Do: under `/vg` → Bars, map, chat → Game windows, untick one group (say "World map, group finder, calendar and Legacy windows"), reload, open the world map.
- Expect: the map is the game's own again; the other groups' windows keep the Vanguard look.
- If it fails, paste: a screenshot and `/vg errors`.

## When you are done

Paste into the first message of the next Claude session: the `/vg report` block (or the output of `/vg status` and `/vg errors`), the list of failed step ids, your screen resolution and UI scale, and the client build from the status line. Failures become tasks in `docs/handoff/WORKPLAN.md` before the performance phase starts.
